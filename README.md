# haploAnalysis
This is a Rscript to generate haplotype blocks and diplotypes for haplotype association analysis. This script has been adapted to Beagle 5.4, original script was written by Solomon Boison based on earlier version of Beagle. To run this script, three files are needed: phased beagle genotypes (vcf file), plink map file, and haploblocks. Haploblocks can be constructed based on fixed distances or based on output from haploview software. The runexample_haplos.R file gives an example of how to run the script.
